# Birth-death-MCMC-Model-Selection

This is R programs to implement the Birth-death MCMC model selection method described in our working paper, "High-dimensional 
Bayesian Model Selection", which is included in this repository as pdf file "bayesian regression.pdf".

# Running this programs

1. The file "bdmcmc algorithm" contains two functions "bdmcmc", and "bdmcmcbin", which are BDMCMC alrotithms for linear regression and 
logistic regression, respectively.

2.The file "regression simulation" contains the data generation functions for linear regression and logistic regression. Some simple 
simulations are also given in the file.


3. The file "Binary" and "gaussian" contains simulations for binary graphical models and Gaussian graphical models.

4. The file "mixed graphical models" is the simulations for mixed graphical models.
