# Birth-death-MCMC-Model-Selection

This is R programs to implement the Scalable Birth-death MCMC model selection method described in our paper, "The scalable Birth-Death MCMC Algorithm for Mixed Graphical Model Learning with Application to Genomic Data Integration".

# Running this programs

1. The file "bdmcmc algorithm_v6.R" contains two functions "bdmcmc", "bdmcmcbin" and "bdmcmcpos", which are SBDMCMC alrotithms for different response variables.

2. run "gaussian_random.R", "gaussian_scale.R", "binary_random.R", "binary_scale.R", "mix_random.R", "mix_scale.R" to get the simulations results for different graphical models.
